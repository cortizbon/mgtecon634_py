# In previous chapters, you learned how to estimate the effect of a binary treatment on an outcome variable. We saw how to estimate the average treatment effect for the entire population $E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$, for specific subgroups $E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | G_i]$, and at specific covariate values $E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)|X_i = x]$. One common feature of these quantities is that they compare the average effect of treating everyone (in the population, subgroup, etc) to the average effect of treating no one. But what if we had a _treatment rule_ that dictated who should be treated, and who should not? Would treating some people according to this rule be better than treating no one? Can we compare two possible treatment rules? Questions like these abound in applied work, so here we'll learn how to answer them using experimental and observational data (with appropriate assumptions).
# 
# Treatment rules that dictate which groups should be treatment are called **policies**. Formally, we'll define a policy (for a binary treatment) to be a mapping from a vector of observable covariates to a number in the unit interval, i.e., $\pi: x \mapsto [0,1]$. Given some vector of covariates $x$, the expression $\pi(x) = 1$ indicates a unit with this covariate value should be treated, $\pi(x) = 0$ indicates no treatment, and  $\pi(x) = p \in (0, 1)$ indicates randomization between treatment and control with probability $p$. 
# 
# There are two main objects of interest in this chapter. The first is the **value** of a policy $\pi$, defined as the average outcome attained if we assign individuals to treatments according to the policy $\pi$,
# 
# $$  E[Y_i(\pi(X_i))]. $$ 
# 
# The second object of interest is the **difference in values** between two policies $\pi$ and $\pi'$,
# 
# $$  E[Y_i(\pi(X_i)) - Y_i(\pi'(X_i))].$$
# 
# Note how the average treatment effect (ATE) we saw in previous chapters is a difference in values taking $\pi(x) \equiv 1 $ (a policy that treats everyone) and $\pi(x) \equiv 0$ (a policy that treats no one).
# 
# Importantly, in this chapter we'll be working with policies that are _pre-specified_ --- that is, that were created or decided _before_ looking at the data. In the next chapter, we'll see how to estimate a policy with desirable properties from the data.

# ## Via sample means
# 
# To fix ideas, we will begin assuming that we are in a _randomized_ setting. For concreteness, let's work with the following toy setting with two uniformly-distributed covariates and a continuous outcome.

n = 1000
p = 4
X = np.reshape(np.random.uniform(0,1,n*p), (n,p))

Y = 0.5*(X[:,0] - 0.5) + (X[:,1] - 0.5)*W + 0.1*norm.rvs(size=n)


# Here is a scatterplot of the data. Each data point is represented by a square if untreated or by a circle if treated in the eperiment. The shade of the point indicates the strength of the outcome, with more negative values being zero and more positive values being darker. 

# In[4]:

# Hereâ€™s a graph of each treated and untreated population separately. Remark two things about this plot. First, the covariate distribution between the two plots is the same --- which is what we should expect in a randomized setting. Second, observations with higher values of $X_2$ react positively to treatment (their blobs are darker than the untreated counterparts, which observations with lower values of $X_2$ react negatively (their blobs are lighter).

# ### Estimating difference in values
# 
# Next, let's estimate the difference in value between two given policies. For a concrete example, letâ€™s consider the gain from switching to $\pi$ defined in {eq}`value_est` from a policy $\pi''$ that never treats, i.e., $\pi''(X_i) \equiv 0$. That is, 
# 
# $$
#   E[Y(\pi(X_i)) - Y(\pi''(X_i))].
# $$ (diff-0)
# 
# We already derived the value of $\pi$ in {eq}`region-a_1`. To derive the value of the second policy,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
#   &E[Y(\pi''(X_i))] \\ 
#     &= E[Y_i(0)] && \text{$\pi''(x) = 0$ for all $x$,}  \\
#     &= E[Y_i(0)|A]P(A) + E[Y_i(0)|A^c]P(A^c) && \text{law of total expectation,} \\
#     &= E[Y|A,W=0]P(A) + E[Y|A^c,W=0]P(A^c) &&\text{randomized setting.} 
# \end{align} (ey0-expand)
# $$
# 
# Substituting {eq}`region-a_1` and {eq}`ey0-expand` into {eq}`diff-0` and simplifying,
# 
# $$
#   E[Y(\pi(X_i)) - Y(\pi''(X_i))]
#     = \left( E[Y_i|A, W_i=1] - E[Y_i|A,W_i=0] \right) \cdot P(A) + 0 \cdot P(A^c) 
# $$ (diff-0-result)
# 
# Expression {eq}`diff-0-result` has the following intepretation. In region $A$, the policy  $\pi$ treats, and the "never treat" policy does not; thus the gain in region $A$ is the average treatment effect in that region, $E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)|A]$, which in a randomized setting equals the first term in parentheses. In region $A^{c}$, the policy $\pi$ does not treat, but neither does the "never treat" policy. Therefore, there the different is exactly zero. The expected difference in values equals the weighted average of the difference in values within each region.

# In[10]:


# Only valid in randomized settings.
A = (X[:,0] > 0.5) & (X[:,1] > 0.5)
diff_estimate = (np.mean(Y[A & (W==1)]) - np.mean(Y[A & (W==0)])) * np.mean(A)
diff_stderr = np.sqrt(np.var(Y[A & (W==1)]) / sum(A & (W==1)) + np.var(Y[A & (W==0)]) / sum(A & W==0)) * np.mean(A)**2
print(f"Difference estimate:", diff_estimate, "Std. Error:", diff_stderr)


# For another example, let's consider the difference in value between $\pi$ and a _random_ policy $\pi'$ that assigns observations to treatment and control with equal probability $p = 1/2$. We have already derived an expression for value of the random policy in {eq}`region-a_1`. Subtracting it from the value of the policy $\pi$ derived in {eq}`pi-pop-value` and simplifying,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align} 
#   E[Y(\pi) - Y(\pi'(X_i))] 
#     &= \frac{P(A)}{2} \left( E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | A] \right) +
#       \frac{P(A^c)}{2} \left( E[Y_i(0) - Y_i(1) | A^c] \right) 
# \end{align}
# $$ (pi-pip-diff-results)
# 
# Here's how to interpret {eq}`pi-pip-diff-results`. In region $A$, policy $\pi$ treats everyone, obtaining average value $E[Y_i(1)|A]$; meanwhile, policy $\pi'$ treats half the observations (i.e., it treats each individual with one-half probability), obtaining average value $(E[Y_i(1) + Y_i(0)|A])/2$. Subtracting the two gives the term multiplying $P(A)$ in {eq}`pi-pip-diff-results`. In region $A^c$, policy $\pi$ treats no one, obtaining average value $E[Y_i(0)|A]$; meanwhile, policy $\pi'$ still obtains $(E[Y_i(1) + Y_i(0)|A^c])/2$ for the same reasons as above. Subtracting the two gives the term multiplying $P(A^c)$ {eq}`pi-pip-diff-results`. Expression {eq}`pi-pip-diff-results` is the average of these two terms weighted by the size of each region. 
# 
# Finally, in a randomized setting, {eq}`pi-pip-diff-results` is equivalent to
# 
# \begin{align}
# \frac{P(A)}{2} \left( E[Y|A,W=1] - E[Y|A,W=0] \right) + 
#         \frac{P(A^c)}{2} \left( E[Y|A^c,W=0] - E[Y|A,W=1] \right),
# \end{align}
# which suggests an estimator based on sample averages as above.

# In[11]:


# Only valid in randomized settings.
A = (X[:,0] > 0.5) & (X[:,1] > 0.5)
diff_estimate = (np.mean(Y[A & (W==1)]) - np.mean(Y[A & (W==0)])) * np.mean(A) / 2 + (np.mean(Y[A!=1 & (W==0)]) - np.mean(Y[A!=1 & (W==1)])) * np.mean(A!=1) / 2
diff_stderr = np.sqrt((np.mean(A)/2)**2 * (np.var(Y[A & (W==1)])/sum(A & (W==1)) + np.var(Y[A & (W==0)])/sum(A & (W==0))) + (np.mean(A!=1)/2)**2 * (np.var(Y[A!=1 & (W==1)])/sum(A!=1 & (W==1)) + np.var(Y[A!=1 & (W==0)])/sum(A!=1 & (W==0))))

# ### Via AIPW scores
# 
# In this section, we will use the following simulated _observational_ setting. Note how the probability of receiving treatment varies by individual, but it depends only on observable characteristics (ensuring unconfoundedness) and it is bounded away from zero and one (ensuring overlap). We assume that assignment probabilities are not known to the researcher.

# <font size=1>
# If we "naively" used the estimators based on sample averages above, the policy value estimate would be biased. Would the bias be upward or downward?
# </font>
# 
# In randomized setting and observational settings with unconfoundedness and overlap, there exists estimates of policy values and differences that are more efficient (i.e., they have smaller variance in large samples) than their counterparts based on sample averages. These are based on the _AIPW scores_ that we studied in previous chapters. For example, to estimate the $E[Y_i(1)]$
# 
# $$
# \begin{align} 
#   \hat {\Gamma}_{i,1}
#     &= \hat{\mu}^{-i}(X_i, 1) + \frac{W_i}{\hat{e}^{-i}(X_i)} \left(Y_i -\hat{\mu}^{-i}(X_i, 1)\right) 
# \end{align}
# $$ (gamma-1)
# 
# 
# As we discussed in the chapter on ATE, averaging over AIPW scores {eq}`gamma-1` across individuals yields an unbiased / consistent estimator of $E[Y_i(1)]$ provided that at least one of $\hat{\mu}^{-i}(x, 1)$ or $\hat{e}^{-i}(x)$ is an unbiased / consistent estimator of the outcome model $\mu(x,w) := E[Y_i(w)|X_i=x]$ or propensity model $e(x) := P[W_i=1|X_i=x]$. Provided that these are estimates using non-parametric methods like forests or neural networks, consistency should be guaranteed, and in addition the resulting estimates should have smaller asymptotic variance. Therefore, barring computational issues, AIPW-based estimates are usually superior to estimates based on sample means, even in randomized settings (though, for completeness, the latter should still be reported when valid).
# 
# For the control, we have the following estimator based on AIPW scores,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align} 
#   \hat {\Gamma}_{i,0} 
#     &= \hat{\mu}^{-i}(X_i, 0) + \frac{1-W_i}{1-\hat{e}^{-i}(X_i)} \left(Y_i -\hat{\mu}^{-i}(X_i, 0)\right).
# \end{align}
# $$ (gamma-0)
# 
# To estimate the value of a binary policy $\pi$, we average over AIPW scores, selecting {eq}`gamma-1` or {eq}`gamma-0` for each individual depending on whether the policy dictates that the individual should be treated or not. That is, we estimate the value of a policy $\pi$ via the following average,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align} 
#   \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat {\Gamma}_{i,\pi(X_i)} 
#   \qquad  
#   \hat {\Gamma}_{i,\pi(X_i)} := \pi(X_i) \hat {\Gamma}_{i,1} + (1 - \pi(X_i)) \hat {\Gamma}_{i,0}.
# \end{align}
# $$

# ## Case study
# 
# For completeness we'll close out this section by estimating policy values using real data. Again, we'll use an abridged version of the General Social Survey (GSS) [(Smith, 2016)](https://gss.norc.org/Documents/reports/project-reports/GSSProject%20report32.pdf) dataset that was introduced in the previous chapter. In this dataset, individuals were sent to treatment or control with equal probability, so we are in a randomized setting.

# Additional covariates
covariates = ["age", "polviews", "income", "educ", "marital", "sex"]


# We'll take the following policy as an example. It asks individuals who are older (age > 50) or more conservative (`polviews` $\leq$ 4) if they think the government spends to much on "welfare", and it asks yonger and more liberal individuals if they think the government spends too much on "assistance to the poor".

#       0 \qquad \text{otherwise}
#     \end{cases}
# $$ (polage)
# 
# We should expect that a higher number of individuals will answer 'yes' because, presumably, older and more conservative individuals in this sample may be more likely to be against welfare in the United States. 
# 
# We selected policy {eq}`polage` purely for illustrative purposes, but it's not hard to come up with examples where understanding how to word certain questions and prompts can be useful. For example, a non-profit that champions assistance to the poor may be able to obtain more donations if they advertise themselves as champions of "welfare" or "assistance to the poor" to different segments of the population.

# 
# [Athey and Wager (2020, Econometrica)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02896) has a good review of the literature on policy learning and evaluation. For a more accessible introduction to the theory, see
# [Stefan Wager's lecture notes](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/stats361.pdf), lecture 7. However, both references focus heavily on policy learning, which will be the topic of the next chapter.
