    "This tutorial will introduce key concepts in machine learning-based causal inference. It’s an ongoing project and new chapters will be uploaded as we finish them. A tentative list of topics that will be covered:\n",

    "* Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "* Average Treatment Effects\n",

    "Please note that this is currently a living document. Chapters marked as “beta” may change substantially and are in most need of feedback. If you find any issues, please feel free to contact Vitor Hadad at vitorh@stanford.edu. The “changelog” below will keep track of major updates and additions."

    "We’ll illustrate key concepts using snippets of Python code. Each chapter in this tutorial is self-contained. You can download the [repository](https://github.com/alexanderquispe/ml_ci_tutorial/tree/main/Python_tutorials). You should be able to rerun most of the code on a different dataset by editing some of the common variables at the top of the notebook (e.g., data, covariates, and outcome). Exceptions to this rule are marked as comments in the text, so please read them carefully."
